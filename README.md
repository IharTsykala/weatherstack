# APIXU is now weatherstack

Through the years, more than 75.000 companies all around the world have started using the product to retrieve different kinds of real-time and historical weather data. 

After months of preparation and work on the technical side of our weather API, APIXU is now officially relaunching as weatherstack - a new, faster, more capable and completely rebuilt REST API service for current weather information, 11-year historical data as well as accurate 14-day weather forecasts. 

In additiono to improved data reliability, consistency and completeness in general, there is a series of new API functionalities that will enhance your user experience and simplify implementation, including translations for 40 languages, bulk queries, hour-by-hour data, astronomy data, location autocomplete, and more. 

## Important: APIXU Shutdown on October 14th, 2019
